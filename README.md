# hello-world
This is my faboulus first GitHub-rep :) :O !

Hi!

I like to improve my coding skills and learn; so, this GitHub-experience is a step in that direction :) I hope to contribute with a few lines to the vast ocean of code, that is GitHub, the internet, and the world! As I said, this is for my learning, but if anyone happens to find my code useful, I'll be glad.
